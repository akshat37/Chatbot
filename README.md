# Chatbot

Cohere Chatbot ðŸ¤–
This is a simple command-line chatbot built using Cohereâ€™s API. It allows you to have interactive conversations powered by Cohereâ€™s large language models. This project is a command-line chatbot built using the Cohere Python SDK. It connects to Cohereâ€™s conversational AI model (command-r-plus) to generate natural and contextual responses based on user input. The chatbot runs in a terminal environment, making it lightweight and easy to use.

ðŸ”¹ Objectives
To integrate Cohereâ€™s LLM into a simple chatbot.
To practice API integration in Python.
To demonstrate a basic human-AI interaction system.
To create a foundation that can later be extended into advanced applications (web app, mobile app, or social media bot).
